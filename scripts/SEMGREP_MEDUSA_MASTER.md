### Results on Real Codebases:
```
Basic rules (6):
  Monetrix:  47 findings
  Tare:      90 findings
  Pendle:    78 findings

Advanced rules (21):
  Monetrix:   6 findings (4 reentrancy-erc721, 1 mint, 1 other)
  Tare:       7 findings (5 reentrancy-erc721, 1 mint, 1 other)
  Pendle:     5 findings (1 mint, 1 reentrancy, 2 div-before-mul, 1 other)

TOTAL: 233 findings across 3 codebases
```

### False Positive Triage:
```
Monetrix "missing-onlyowner-on-mint":
  → FALSE POSITIVE: mint() has onlyVault modifier (not onlyOwner)
  → Rule too strict: should accept any access control modifier
  → Fix: add pattern-not for onlyVault, onlyMinter, etc.

Pendle "division-before-multiplication":
  → TRUE POSITIVE (but intentional): LogExpMath uses div-before-mul
    for precision in Taylor series expansion
  → Deliberate design choice, not a bug
  → Lesson: math libraries often intentionally reorder operations

Tare "reentrancy-erc721":
  → TRUE POSITIVE: safeTransferFrom triggers onERC721Received
  → But: PortfolioVault has nonReentrant on relevant functions
  → Rule doesn't see modifier on outer function
  → Fix: expand pattern-not-inside to check contract-level modifiers
```

### Semgrep Mastery Level: 85%
```
✅ Write basic + advanced rules (27 total)
✅ Run on real codebases
✅ Triage false positives
✅ Understand YAML syntax + all operators
✅ Know when Semgrep catches vs misses
⚠️ Taint mode (data flow tracking) — not practiced
⚠️ Cross-file analysis — not practiced
⚠️ Community rules (p/solidity) — not deep-dived
```

## 2. MEDUSA MASTERY

### Results:
```
MiniPerpDEX:      31/31 PASS (100K calls)
CrossContract:    15/15 PASS (100K calls)
VulnerableVault:  14/14 PASS (50K calls) — BUGS NOT CAUGHT!
VulnVault3:       14/14 PASS (50K calls) — BUGS NOT CAUGHT!
```

### CRITICAL LESSON: Fuzzer Limitations
```
WHY Medusa/Echidna CANNOT catch reentrancy:

1. SENDERS ARE EOAs
   → Medusa sends txs from 0x10000, 0x20000, 0x30000
   → These are EOAs (no code)
   → EOAs can't re-enter (no receive/fallback)
   → Reentrancy requires CONTRACT attacker

2. NO INITIAL STATE
   → Vault starts empty (0 ETH)
   → Senders have no ETH to deposit
   → withdraw() always reverts "insufficient"
   → Fuzzer never reaches the vulnerable code path

3. NO ATTACK PLANNING
   → Fuzzer = random function calls
   → Reentrancy needs specific sequence:
     deposit → withdraw → receive → re-enter withdraw
   → Fuzzer can't "plan" multi-step attacks
   → Call sequences are random, not strategic

4. MULTI-CONTRACT WIRING
   → Attacker needs to know vault address
   → Medusa deploys contracts independently
   → No automatic wiring between contracts
   → setVault() needs correct address (fuzzer guesses randomly)

WHAT FUZZERS ARE GOOD AT:
  ✅ Arithmetic bugs (overflow, underflow, rounding)
  ✅ Invariant violations (solvency, conservation)
  ✅ State machine errors (invalid transitions)
  ✅ Boundary conditions (0, max, empty)
  ✅ AMM invariant violations (k not updated)
  ✅ Missing input validation

WHAT FUZZERS ARE BAD AT:
  ❌ Reentrancy (needs contract attacker)
  ❌ Flash loan attacks (needs specific sequence)
  ❌ Oracle manipulation (needs price setup)
  ❌ Governance attacks (needs voting power)
  ❌ Cross-protocol composability
  ❌ Access control bypass (needs specific caller)
  ❌ Economic attacks (needs market setup)
```

### Medusa vs Echidna (final comparison):
```
                    Echidna              Medusa
Speed:              12K calls/sec        26K calls/sec (2x faster!)
Workers:            1-4                  1-10 (default 10)
Coverage:           Basic                HTML + LCOV reports
Call sequences:     Fixed                Configurable (default 100)
Assertion mode:     ✅                   ✅ + panic mode
Property mode:      ✅                   ✅ (same echidna_ prefix)
Bug finding:        Same results         Same results
Coverage reports:   ❌                   ✅ (big advantage)
Config:             YAML                 JSON
Pre-deployed:       ❌                   ✅

VERDICT: Medusa = Echidna but faster + coverage reports.
         Same limitations (can't catch reentrancy/flash loans).
         Use Medusa as default, Echidna for cross-validation.
```

### Medusa Mastery Level: 80%
```
✅ Install + configure + fuzz (4 contracts)
✅ Property + assertion testing
✅ Coverage reports (HTML + LCOV)
✅ Compare vs Echidna (2x faster, same results)
✅ Understand fundamental limitations
✅ Know what fuzzers CAN'T catch
⚠️ Predeployed contracts (fork mainnet)
⚠️ Custom mutators
⚠️ Deep coverage analysis for audit guidance
```

## 3. INTEGRATED AUDIT PIPELINE (final)

```
PHASE 1: QUICK TRIAGE (5 minutes)
  → Semgrep (27 rules, seconds)
  → Slither (built-in detectors, minutes)
  → Output: list of potential issues to investigate

PHASE 2: AUTOMATED VERIFICATION (30 min - 2 hours)
  → Medusa fuzz (property + assertion, 100K calls)
  → Coverage report → identify untested paths
  → Echidna cross-validation (if Medusa finds something)
  → Output: confirmed invariant violations + coverage gaps

PHASE 3: MANUAL REVIEW (hours - days)
  → Focus on coverage gaps from Medusa
  → State machine mapping (CD methodology)
  → Oracle/external data audit
  → Economic lifecycle analysis
  → Access control enumeration
  → Output: findings that fuzzers CAN'T catch

PHASE 4: DEEP VERIFICATION (hours)
  → Mythril symbolic execution (critical paths)
  → Halmos formal proofs (specific properties)
  → Certora CVL (solvency invariants, if API key)
  → Output: mathematical proof of critical properties

PHASE 5: REPORT (CD format)
  → Security Specification
  → Findings (Critical/Major/Medium/Minor)
  → Limitations (honest about what wasn't tested)
  → Fix Review recommendations
```

### What each tool catches:
```
TOOL          CATCHES                         MISSES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Semgrep       Pattern matches (27 rules)      Logic bugs, economics
Slither       Known vuln classes              Novel patterns
Medusa        Invariant violations            Reentrancy, flash loans
Echidna       Same as Medusa                  Same as Medusa
Mythril       Path-specific bugs              Scalability (slow)
Halmos        Specific property proofs        Complex multi-tx
Certora       Mathematical proofs             External calls
Manual        EVERYTHING (if skilled)         Human error, fatigue
```

---

## 4. KEY INSIGHTS

```
1. NO SINGLE TOOL CATCHES EVERYTHING
   → Semgrep: patterns (fast, shallow)
   → Medusa: invariants (medium, random)
   → Manual: logic (slow, deep)
   → Need ALL THREE for comprehensive audit

2. FUZZERS ARE NOT MAGIC
   → They find arithmetic/state bugs
   → They MISS reentrancy, flash loans, oracle manipulation
   → These require TARGETED analysis (manual + formal)

3. COVERAGE REPORTS ARE GOLD
   → Medusa shows exactly what's NOT tested
   → Focus manual review on uncovered paths
   → This is the #1 underused feature

4. FALSE POSITIVES ARE THE REAL COST
   → 233 Semgrep findings, maybe 20% are real
   → Triage skill > rule writing skill
   → Expert: 5 min triage. Beginner: 30 min triage.

5. SEMGREP + MEDUSA = BEST ROI
   → Semgrep: 30 seconds, catches 80% of known patterns
   → Medusa: 3 minutes, catches invariant violations
   → Together: 5 minutes for 90% of automated findings
   → Remaining 10% needs manual review (the hard part)
