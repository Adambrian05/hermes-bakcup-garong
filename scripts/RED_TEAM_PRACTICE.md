## RED TEAM MINDSET (Halborn)

```
Traditional audit: "Is this code correct?"
Red team:         "How do I steal money from this?"

88% of crypto losses = OPERATIONAL failures (not code bugs!)
→ Key management, social engineering, infrastructure
→ NOT just smart contract vulnerabilities
```

## ATTACK SURFACE ANALYSIS: MONETRIX

### Target Profile:
```
Protocol:   Monetrix (yield layer for Hyperliquid)
TVL:        ~$10M (estimated)
Chain:      HyperEVM (Hyperliquid L1)
Assets:     USDC → USDM → sUSDM
Roles:      User, Operator, Guardian, Governor, Upgrader
```

### Attack Path 1: OPERATOR KEY COMPROMISE (HIGHEST RISK)
```
Operator can (delay=0, no timelock):
  → keeperBridge: send ALL netBridgeable USDC to L1
  → executeHedge: open arbitrary positions
  → settle(proposedYield): declare yield (bounded by 4 gates)
  → distributeYield: split yield
  → fundRedemptions / reclaimFromRedeemEscrow: move USDC

Attack:
  1. Compromise operator key (phishing, malware)
  2. keeperBridge → drain ALL vault USDC to L1
  3. On L1: withdraw to attacker-controlled address
  4. Total time: < 1 minute
  5. Damage: entire vault USDC balance

Mitigation gap:
  → No multi-sig on operator actions
  → No transaction delay
  → No amount limits on bridge (only netBridgeable)
  → Guardian can pause, but reaction time > attack time

Severity: CRITICAL (if operator = single EOA)
```

### Attack Path 2: GOVERNOR KEY COMPROMISE (24h TIMELOCK)
```
Governor can (24h timelock):
  → setAccountant: replace with malicious accountant
  → setRedeemEscrow: replace with malicious escrow
  → emergencyRawAction: send ANY data to HyperCore
  → setMultisigVault: redirect bridge destination

Attack:
  1. Compromise governor key
  2. Queue emergencyRawAction (malicious HyperCore data)
  3. Wait 24h
  4. Execute → arbitrary HyperCore action

Mitigation:
  → 24h timelock gives community time to react
  → Guardian can pause during timelock
  → BUT: if guardian also compromised → game over

Severity: HIGH (24h delay mitigates, but emergencyRawAction is scary)
```

### Attack Path 3: REENTRANCY (Aderyn H-2)
```
Aderyn found 13 instances of state change after external call.
Most critical: MonetrixVault.requestRedeem()

  IRedeemEscrow(redeemEscrow).addObligation(usdmAmount);  // external call
  requestId = nextRedeemId++;                               // state change AFTER
  redeemRequests[requestId] = RedeemRequest({...});         // state change AFTER
  _userRedeemIds[msg.sender].push(requestId);               // state change AFTER

BUT: function has nonReentrant modifier → BLOCKED
Aderyn flags it as pattern violation, but nonReentrant prevents exploit.

Verdict: FALSE POSITIVE (mitigated by nonReentrant)
Lesson: Aderyn doesn't check for nonReentrant modifier context
```

### Attack Path 4: ORACLE MANIPULATION (HyperEVM-specific)
```
Monetrix reads L1 state via precompiles:
  → PrecompileReader.accountValueSigned()
  → PrecompileReader.spotBalance()
  → PrecompileReader.suppliedBalance()
  → PrecompileReader.vaultEquity()

These are HyperEVM precompiles (0x801, 0x807, 0x808, 0x811)
→ NOT Chainlink oracles
→ Read directly from Hyperliquid L1 state
→ Manipulation requires manipulating Hyperliquid itself

Attack:
  1. Flash loan on Hyperliquid spot market
  2. Dump asset → crash precompile price
  3. Accountant.totalBackingSigned() drops
  4. distributableSurplus() goes negative
  5. settle() blocked (Gate 3: no distributable surplus)

BUT: this BLOCKS yield, doesn't enable theft
Precompile manipulation = griefing, not profit

Severity: MEDIUM (griefing, not direct theft)
```

### Attack Path 5: SOCIAL ENGINEERING (Halborn specialty)
```
From Quantstamp April 2026 Security Beat:
  → Drift Protocol: $285M lost to DPRK social engineering
  → 6-month infiltration (fake trading firm identity)
  → In-person meetings at conferences
  → Blind-signing via Solana durable nonce
  → Admin control transferred silently

Applied to Monetrix:
  1. Attacker poses as Hyperliquid ecosystem partner
  2. Builds relationship with Monetrix team over months
  3. Gets added as operator or guardian
  4. Executes Attack Path 1 or 2

This is the MOST LIKELY attack vector.
Not a code bug — a HUMAN bug.

Severity: CRITICAL (most likely, hardest to prevent)
```

### Attack Path 6: SUPPLY CHAIN (npm/dependency)
```
From Quantstamp April 2026:
  → Axios npm compromised: 600K installs in 3 hours
  → Mini Shai-Hulud worm: 1000+ malicious npm packages
  → Vercel breached via Context.ai (third-party)

Applied to Monetrix:
  → HyperEVM SDK dependency compromised
  → OpenZeppelin contracts compromised (unlikely but possible)
  → Build pipeline compromised
  → Frontend compromised (user signs malicious tx)

Severity: HIGH (supply chain attacks are increasing)
```

## RED TEAM FINDINGS SUMMARY

```
PATH 1: Operator key compromise     → CRITICAL (no multi-sig, no delay)
PATH 2: Governor key compromise     → HIGH (24h timelock mitigates)
PATH 3: Reentrancy                  → FALSE POSITIVE (nonReentrant)
PATH 4: Oracle manipulation         → MEDIUM (griefing only)
PATH 5: Social engineering          → CRITICAL (most likely vector)
PATH 6: Supply chain                → HIGH (increasing trend)

MOST DANGEROUS: PATH 5 (social engineering)
  → 88% of losses from operational failures
  → Hardest to detect, longest to execute
  → DPRK groups actively targeting DeFi teams

MOST EXPLOITABLE: PATH 1 (operator compromise)
  → Single key = full drain
  → No timelock, no multi-sig
  → < 1 minute attack time
```

## RED TEAM vs TRADITIONAL AUDIT

```
TRADITIONAL AUDIT found:
  → Aderyn: 2 HIGH + 15 LOW (code patterns)
  → Semgrep: 53 findings (pattern matches)
  → Manual: 2 Major + 1 Medium (logic bugs)

RED TEAM found (ADDITIONAL):
  → Operator single-key risk (CRITICAL)
  → Social engineering vector (CRITICAL)
  → Supply chain risk (HIGH)
  → emergencyRawAction arbitrary data (HIGH)
  → Oracle griefing via precompile (MEDIUM)

RED TEAM catches what code review MISSES:
  → Operational risks (keys, humans, infrastructure)
  → Attack sequencing (multi-step, multi-vector)
  → Realistic threat actors (DPRK, insiders, competitors)
  → Time dimension (6-month infiltration)
```
