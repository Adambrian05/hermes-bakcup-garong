# Vulnerability details

## Impact
Line 214 of Well.sol calculates the price of tokens to tokens in the pool based on the balances at a single point in time. Pool balances at a single point in time can be manipulated with flash loans, which can skew the numbers to the extreme. The single data point of LP balances is used to calculate the amountOut in line 231, and the amountOut influences the number of tokens a user receives in the transfer on line 236.


```
    function _swapFrom(
        IERC20 fromToken,
        IERC20 toToken,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
        uint256[] memory reserves = _updatePumps(_tokens.length);
        (uint256 i, uint256 j) = _getIJ(_tokens, fromToken, toToken);

        reserves[i] += amountIn;
        uint256 reserveJBefore = reserves[j];
        reserves[j] = _calcReserve(wellFunction(), reserves, j, totalSupply());

        // Note: The rounding approach of the Well function determines whether
        // slippage from imprecision goes to the Well or to the User.
        amountOut = reserveJBefore - reserves[j];
        if (amountOut < minAmountOut) {
            revert SlippageOut(amountOut, minAmountOut);
        }

        toToken.safeTransfer(recipient, amountOut);
        emit Swap(fromToken, toToken, amountIn, amountOut, recipient);
        _setReserves(_tokens, reserves);
    }

## Proof of Concept

```
    function _swapFrom(
        ...


        reserves[i] += amountIn;
        uint256 reserveJBefore = reserves[j];
        reserves[j] = _calcReserve(wellFunction(), reserves, j, totalSupply());

        // Note: The rounding approach of the Well function determines whether
        // slippage from imprecision goes to the Well or to the User.
        amountOut = reserveJBefore - reserves[j];
        if (amountOut < minAmountOut) {
            revert SlippageOut(amountOut, minAmountOut);
        }

        toToken.safeTransfer(recipient, amountOut);
        emit Swap(fromToken, toToken, amountIn, amountOut, recipient);
        _setReserves(_tokens, reserves);
    }
```

An attacker can take out a flashloan in order to increase the value of reserveJBefore. The attacker can then temporarily increase the amount of reserveJ in the pool and then swap reserve[i] for reserveJ.`_swapFrom` will take the reservesBefore and subtract it from the current reserves. Since reserveJ is higher than usual due to the flash loan when amountOut is calculated it will cause the pool to be drained giving the attacker more tokens than they should be getting.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a short TWAP to calculate the trade size instead of reading directly from the pool.
