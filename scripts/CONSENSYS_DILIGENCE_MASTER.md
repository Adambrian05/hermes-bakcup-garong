## 1. FINDING PATTERNS (from 5 reports, 100+ findings)

### Reports studied:
```
1. Lido V3 (Aug 2025) — 43 findings, 2 Critical, 5 Major
2. cETH (Apr 2026) — 10 findings, 0 Critical, 1 Medium
3. Denaria 2 (Sep 2025) — 23 findings, 4 Critical, 5 Major
4. USDi (Apr 2025) — 25 findings, 0 Critical, 3 Major
5. Monetrix (IRONCLAW practice) — 5 findings, 0 Critical, 2 Major
```

### Pattern Taxonomy (ranked by frequency):

```
CATEGORY 1: STATE MACHINE / LIFECYCLE ERRORS (35% of Critical/Major)
  → State not cleared on disconnect/reconnect (Lido V3: 3 findings)
  → Quarantine/delay bypass via report reuse (Lido V3: Critical)
  → Exposure remains open after position close (Denaria: Major)
  → Blacklist doesn't block transfers (USDi: Major)
  → Auto-close not disabled after execution (Denaria: Minor)
  
  HOW TO FIND:
    Map every lifecycle transition. For EACH:
    - List ALL state variables that should change
    - Verify each one DOES change
    - Check: what happens if transition is interrupted?
    - Check: what happens if transition is repeated?
    - Check: what happens if transitions are reordered?

CATEGORY 2: ECONOMIC / ACCOUNTING ERRORS (25% of Critical/Major)
  → Infinite bad debt from position close (Denaria: Critical)
  → PnL avoidance through zero exposure (Denaria: Critical)
  → LP/trader liquidity mix corrupts open interest (Denaria: Major)
  → Incorrect fee handling during withdrawals (USDi: Major)
  → Fees can go up to 100% (cETH: Minor)
  → Vault fees indefinitely deferred (Lido V3: Medium)
  
  HOW TO FIND:
    Model the FULL economic lifecycle:
    - Where does value ENTER?
    - Where does value EXIT?
    - Can any path create value from nothing?
    - Can any path destroy value without accounting?
    - Are fees enforced at EVERY exit point?
    - What happens at boundary: 0, max, expiry?

CATEGORY 3: ORACLE / EXTERNAL DATA (15% of Critical/Major)
  → Liquidation with infinitely bad price (Denaria: Critical)
  → Oracle inverted price validity (Denaria: Major)
  → PnL manipulated via AMM price (Denaria: Major)
  → Chainlink latestRoundData stale (USDi: Minor)
  → Report reuse bypasses quarantine (Lido V3: Critical)
  
  HOW TO FIND:
    For every external data input:
    - Replay protection? (nonce, hash)
    - Freshness check? (timestamp, block)
    - Bounds check? (min, max, sanity)
    - Manipulation cost? (flash loan, sandwich)
    - Stale data fallback? (revert, default)
    - Inverted price check? (for forex/pairs)

CATEGORY 4: ACCESS CONTROL / TRUST (15% of Critical/Major)
  → Protocol value drainage via liquidation manipulation (Denaria: Critical)
  → LP debt transfer allows debt avoidance (Denaria: Major)
  → Unrestricted withdrawal by admin (USDi: Medium)
  → Lack of roles segregation (USDi: Acknowledged)
  → reclaimFromRedeemEscrow unbounded (Monetrix: Major)
  
  HOW TO FIND:
    Enumerate ALL external functions:
    - Who can call each?
    - What's the worst-case action?
    - Is there a bound on the action?
    - Can roles collude?
    - Can a single role drain funds?

CATEGORY 5: FIX REVIEW REGRESSIONS (10% of Critical/Major)
  → Fix introduces NEW vulnerability (Denaria 6.1: Critical!)
  → Re-introduction of removed library (USDi 6.1: Major)
  → Blacklist blocks burns (USDi 6.3: Major)
  
  HOW TO FIND:
    After ANY fix:
    - Re-audit the changed function AND its callers
    - Check: does the fix break an invariant elsewhere?
    - Check: does the fix create a new edge case?
    - Check: was the fix applied consistently everywhere?
```

## 2. SCRIBBLE MASTERY (hands-on verified)

### 2.1 Annotation Types (all tested):
```
FUNCTION ANNOTATIONS:
  /// #if_succeeds <expr>;     — postcondition (checked after function)
  /// #require <expr>;         — precondition (checked before function)
  old(expr)                    — value of expr before function execution
  result / named return        — return value reference

CONTRACT ANNOTATIONS:
  /// #invariant <expr>;       — checked before/after EVERY transaction
  → Must be in /// docstring directly before `contract` keyword
  → NOT inside the contract body
  → Can use sum(mapping) for aggregate properties

STATE VARIABLE ANNOTATIONS:
  /// #if_updated <expr>;      — checked whenever variable is written
  → NOT supported on public variables (getter conflict)
  → Use #if_succeeds on setter functions instead

ASSERT ANNOTATIONS:
  /// #assert <expr>;          — checked at specific point in function
  → Place before a statement, checked at that point
  → Can reference local variables in scope

HELPER ANNOTATIONS:
  /// #define name(args) ret = expr;  — reusable expression
  → Only usable in annotations, NOT in Solidity code
  → Reduces duplication in complex properties
```

### 2.2 Common Mistakes (learned the hard way):
```
❌ __ret / RET / _ret → use named returns (uint256 result)
❌ {:old expr} → use old(expr)
❌ #invariant inside contract body → put in docstring BEFORE contract
❌ #if_updated on public var → use #if_succeeds on setter
❌ #define used in Solidity code → only works in annotations
❌ Forgot git init → Scribble needs project root for metadata
❌ Forgot --path-remapping → can't find imports
❌ Forgot --instrumentation-metadata-file → can't detect project root
```

### 2.3 Working Scribble CLI:
```bash
# Instrument (arm)
npx scribble src/Contract.sol --arm \
  --instrumentation-metadata-file .scribble.json \
  --path-remapping "@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/" \
  --base-path .

# Disarm (restore original)
npx scribble src/Contract.sol --disarm \
  --instrumentation-metadata-file .scribble.json

# Run with Echidna (assertion mode)
echidna src/Contract.sol --contract ContractName \
  --config echidna-config.yaml

# echidna-config.yaml:
# testMode: assertion
# testLimit: 50000
# shrinkLimit: 1000
```

### 2.4 Scribble + Echidna Results:
```
TokenMath (Monetrix):
  → 6 properties, 50K fuzz, 7/7 PASS
  → Coverage: 925 instructions

MiniVault (practice):
  → 2 invariants + 8 function annotations + 1 assert
  → 50K fuzz, 14/14 PASS
  → Coverage: 1185 instructions
  → Contract invariants checked on EVERY tx
```

## 3. CD REPORT FORMAT (standardized template)

```
1. Executive Summary
   → Overall assessment (honest, sometimes harsh)
   → Key risk areas identified
   → Recommendation: deploy / delay / don't deploy
   → "We recommend delaying production deployment" (Lido V3)
   → "Safe to operate within that model" (cETH)

2. Scope
   → Exact repo + commit hash(es)
   → Fix-review commits (if applicable)
   → PRs reviewed during fix phase
   → What's IN scope, what's OUT

3. System Overview
   → Architecture description
   → Link to protocol docs
   → Key contracts and their roles

4. Security Specification
   4.1 Actors (who interacts)
   4.2 Trust Model (who is trusted, with what)
   4.3 Security Properties (invariants)

5. Continuous Fuzzing (if applicable)
   → Existing invariants
   → Coverage assessment

6. Invariant Fuzzing
   6.1 Architecture of fuzzing suite
   6.2 Limitations and testing assumptions
   6.3+ Specific invariants per component

7. Findings
   → Severity: Critical / Major / Medium / Minor
   → Status: ✓ Fixed / Acknowledged / Partially Addressed
   → Each: description + code snippet + recommendation

8. Fix Review Findings (separate section!)
   → NEW bugs found during fix verification
   → Regressions from remediation

Appendix: Disclosure, files in scope
```

### Severity Definitions (from reports):
```
CRITICAL: Direct fund loss, protocol insolvency, unauthorized minting
  Examples: "Minting Uncollateralized stETH"
            "Infinite Bad Debt"
            "Protocol Value Drainage"

MAJOR: Significant logic error, security mechanism bypass
  Examples: "Quarantine Bypass"
            "Open Interest Corruption"
            "Oracle Inverted Price"

MEDIUM: Conditional exploit, fee bypass, missing validation
  Examples: "Fees Indefinitely Deferred"
            "Stale Vault Data Operations"
            "Withdrawal Race Condition"

MINOR: Code quality, best practice, gas optimization
  Examples: "Unused Import"
            "Event Indexing"
            "Storage Variable Ordering"
```

---

## 4. AUDIT PROCESS (reconstructed from 5 reports)

```
PHASE 1: Scoping (days 1-3)
  → Define scope + commit hash with client
  → Identify trust model + actors
  → Agree on security properties
  → Set objectives (correctness, known vulns, role separation)

PHASE 2: Initial Review (1-10 weeks depending on size)
  → Manual code review (PRIMARY method)
  → Automated: Mythril, Slither, custom scripts
  → Invariant specification (Scribble annotations)
  → Fuzzing campaign setup + execution
  → Regular syncs with client team
  → Findings reported incrementally

PHASE 3: Fix Review (1-5 weeks)
  → Client fixes findings
  → Diligence verifies EACH fix
  → Check for REGRESSIONS (critical! Denaria found NEW Critical in fix)
  → Re-audit changed code + callers
  → Best-effort review of late PRs
  → "New vulnerabilities were still being identified" (Lido V3)

PHASE 4: Report Finalization
  → Final commit hash documented
  → All findings categorized + status updated
  → Executive summary written (honest assessment)
  → Published (if client agrees)

EFFORT (from reports):
  → cETH: 2 auditors × 4 days = 8 person-days
  → USDi: 2 auditors × 5 days = 10 person-days
  → Denaria 2: 2 auditors × 3 weeks = 30 person-days
  → Lido V3: 3 auditors × 10 weeks + 5 weeks fix = 225 person-days
```

## 5. KEY INSIGHTS FROM REPORTS

### 5.1 Fix Review is CRITICAL (Denaria lesson)
```
Denaria 2 finding 6.1: "Protocol Value Drainage Through
Liquidation Manipulation" — CRITICAL found during FIX REVIEW

→ The fix for an earlier finding INTRODUCED a new Critical
→ Without fix review, this would have shipped to production
→ Lesson: ALWAYS re-audit fixes, especially for complex protocols
```

### 5.2 Complexity = Bugs (Lido V3 lesson)
```
"The VaultHub contract managed many responsibilities,
resulting in complex flows that are challenging to audit"

"The code still has high complexity, and by the end of
the audit, new vulnerabilities were still being identified"

→ More complex = more bugs, even after 10 weeks
→ Recommendation: "delaying production deployment"
→ Lesson: Complexity is the #1 enemy of security
```

### 5.3 Trust Model Matters (cETH lesson)
```
"Under the trust assumptions and threat model documented
in this report, the deployed code is safe to operate"

"Safe operation still depends on disciplined key management,
multisig processes, and monitoring"

→ Security is RELATIVE to trust model
→ Same code can be "safe" or "unsafe" depending on who controls keys
→ Lesson: Always define trust model BEFORE auditing
```

### 5.4 AMM/Perp Protocols are HARDEST (Denaria lesson)
```
4 Critical + 5 Major in a perp DEX
→ PnL manipulation, infinite bad debt, liquidation exploits
→ AMM price manipulation affects ALL positions
→ Individual accounting + shared liquidity = complex interactions
→ Lesson: Perp/AMM protocols need the most audit time
```

### 5.5 Stablecoins have FEE/ACCESS bugs (USDi lesson)
```
3 Major: fee handling, admin withdrawal, blacklist
→ Stablecoin bugs are usually in the EDGES
→ Fee tiers, whitelist delays, oracle peg checks
→ Lesson: Check every fee path + every admin function
```

## 6. SMART CONTRACT BEST PRACTICES (successor: secure-contracts.com)

### Key sections:
```
1. General Philosophy
   → "Prepare for failure" — assume bugs exist
   → "Keep contracts simple" — complexity kills
   → "Stay up to date" — track EVM changes
   → "Be aware of trade-offs" — security vs gas vs features

2. Development Recommendations
   → Code maturity criteria
   → Token integration checklist
   → Incident response planning
   → Secure development workflow

3. Known Attacks (Not So Smart Contracts)
   → Reentrancy, overflow, access control
   → Front-running, oracle manipulation
   → Governance attacks, flash loan attacks
   → Cross-contract reentrancy

4. Security Tools
   → Echidna (fuzzer) — with exercises
   → Medusa (next-gen fuzzer)
   → Slither (static analyzer)
   → Manticore (symbolic execution)
   → Each has: theory + API + 2-hour exercises
```

  ⚠️ Flash loan attack vectors in complex DeFi
```

### Echidna Bug-Finding Track Record:
```
MiniPerpDEX (perp DEX):
  Bug 1: k invariant not updated after openLong/openShort → AMM broken
  Bug 2: No initial LP shares → first LP drains entire pool
  Bug 3: No marginAmount upper bound → pool drain via huge trade
  Bug 4: k not updated in liquidate() → AMM broken after liquidation
  Bug 5: k not updated in closePosition() → AMM broken after close
  ALL 5 found by Echidna in <100K fuzz calls each
  ALL 5 fixed + verified with re-run

CrossContractTest (Vault+Token+Escrow):
  5 invariants, 100K fuzz, ALL PASS (no bugs — correct by construction)

TokenMath (Monetrix):
  6 properties, 50K fuzz, ALL PASS

MiniVault:
  2 invariants + 8 annotations, 50K fuzz, ALL PASS

GhostVault:
  3 ghost variables + annotations, 50K fuzz, ALL PASS
```

### Key Lesson from Perp DEX Practice:
```
AMM-based protocols MUST update k after EVERY reserve modification.
Missing k update = #1 most common AMM bug.
Echidna finds this in <1000 fuzz calls.
Manual review often misses it because each function looks correct in isolation.
→ This is WHY CD uses invariant fuzzing as core methodology.
```
