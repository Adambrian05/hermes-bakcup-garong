## 1. SLITHER — REAL RESULTS

### 1.1 Full Scan (audit project)
```bash
cd ~/.hermes/superagent-v7/audit
slither src/ --detect all
```

**Findings on our PoC code:**
```
Detector: reentrancy-no-eth (HIGH)
  MockTrancheV2.deposit():
    External call: asset.transferFrom() BEFORE state update
    State written after: _totalAssets += assets, totalSupply += shares
    Cross-function reentrancy: _totalAssets used in convertToShares()
    
  → This is INTENTIONAL in our PoC (mimics Arcadia's pattern)
  → In production: this IS the vulnerability

Detector: unchecked-transfer (HIGH)
  16 instances across Basin + Arcadia PoCs
  → token.transferFrom() without checking return value
  → Expected in test code, CRITICAL in production

Detector: incorrect-equality (MEDIUM)
  product == 0, x == 0
  → Dangerous strict equality on computed values
  → Could miss edge cases

Detector: incorrect-shift (HIGH)
  forge-std StdStorage: mask = 1 << 256 - offsetRight + offsetLeft - 1 << offsetRight
  → Operator precedence bug in forge-std (known, not exploitable)

Detector: shadowing-state (LOW)
  StdCheats.vm shadows StdCheatsSafe.vm
  → forge-std internal, not exploitable
```

### 1.2 Useful Slither Commands
```bash
# All detectors
slither . --detect all

# Specific detectors
slither . --detect reentrancy-eth,reentrancy-no-eth,unchecked-transfer
slither . --detect arbitrary-send,unprotected-upgrade
slither . --detect uninitialized-state,uninitialized-local

# Printers (analysis, not detection)
slither . --print human-summary        # Overview
slither . --print inheritance-graph    # Contract hierarchy
slither . --print data-dependency      # Variable dependency graph
slither . --print function-summary     # Function visibility/coverage

# Filter by contract
slither . --filter-contracts "MyContract"

# JSON output (for automation)
slither . --json output.json

# Exclude false positives
slither . --exclude-informational --exclude-low
```

### 1.3 Custom Detector (Written)
```python
# /tmp/slither-custom/donation_detector.py
# Detects: functions that increase vault assets WITHOUT minting shares
# Pattern: totalAssets += X without _mint() or totalSupply += Y
# Impact: HIGH (donation/inflation attack vector)

class DonationInflationDetector(AbstractDetector):
    ARGUMENT = "donation-inflation"
    IMPACT = DetectorClassification.HIGH
    CONFIDENCE = DetectorClassification.MEDIUM
    
    def _detect(self):
        # For each public/external function:
        # 1. Check if it increases totalAssets/realisedLiquidity
        # 2. Check if it does NOT mint shares
        # 3. If both → flag as inflation attack vector
```

### 1.4 Slither Limitations (Learned)
```
❌ Doesn't understand business logic
   → Flags reentrancy in test mocks (false positive)
   → Can't tell "intentional" from "vulnerable"

❌ Doesn't trace cross-contract flows
   → LendingPool calls Tranche → Slither sees them separately
   → Need manual analysis for composability

❌ Doesn't model economics
   → Can't detect "share price manipulation"
   → Only detects code patterns, not attack profitability

✅ Best for: TRIAGE (first pass)
   → Run Slither FIRST
   → Filter true positives manually
   → Focus human review on flagged areas
```

## 2. ECHIDNA — REAL RESULTS

### 2.1 Stateless Fuzzing (50K runs)
```bash
cd /tmp/echidna-test
echidna VaultInvariant.sol --contract VaultInvariant \
  --test-mode assertion --test-limit 50000
```

**Result:**
```
test_inflation_attack(): passing
AssertionFailed(..): passing
Unique instructions: 1263
Corpus size: 3
Total calls: 50242

→ All invariants held across 50K random inputs
→ BUT: stateless = each call is independent
→ Doesn't test SEQUENCES of operations
```

### 2.2 Stateful Fuzzing (100K runs)
```bash
echidna StatefulVault.sol --contract VaultFuzz \
  --test-mode assertion --test-limit 100000
```

**Result:**
```
fuzz_deposit1(uint256): passing
fuzz_deposit2(uint256): passing
fuzz_donate(uint256): passing
fuzz_withdraw1(uint256): passing
AssertionFailed(..): passing
Unique instructions: 1658
Corpus size: 4
Total calls: 100177

→ Stateful: tests SEQUENCES (deposit → donate → withdraw)
→ 100K random operation sequences
→ Invariants: solvency + no theft
→ All held
```

### 2.3 Writing Good Echidna Properties
```solidity
// GOOD: Invariant that should ALWAYS hold
function echidna_solvency() public view returns (bool) {
    return vault.totalAssets() >= vault.totalSupply() 
        || vault.totalSupply() == 0;
}

// GOOD: Conservation (no value created from nothing)
function echidna_conservation() public view returns (bool) {
    return vault.totalAssets() == totalDeposited - totalWithdrawn + totalDonated;
}

// BAD: Property that depends on specific state
function echidna_my_balance() public view returns (bool) {
    return vault.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0; // Fails if no deposit
}

// STATEFUL HARNESS PATTERN:
contract FuzzHarness {
    // Track expected state
    uint256 totalDeposited;
    uint256 totalWithdrawn;
    
    function fuzz_deposit(uint256 amt) public {
        amt = (amt % 1000 ether) + 1;  // Bound input
        vault.deposit(amt);
        totalDeposited += amt;
    }
    
    function fuzz_withdraw(uint256 amt) public {
        uint256 bal = vault.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (bal == 0) return;  // Skip if nothing to withdraw
        amt = (amt % bal) + 1;
        vault.withdraw(amt);
        totalWithdrawn += amt;
    }
    
    function echidna_accounting() public view returns (bool) {
        return vault.totalAssets() == totalDeposited - totalWithdrawn;
    }
}
```

### 2.4 Echidna Config (echidna.yaml)
```yaml
testLimit: 100000
shrinkLimit: 5000
coverage: true
corpusDir: "corpus"
testMode: "assertion"  # or "property"
deployer: "0x10000"
sender: ["0x10000", "0x20000", "0x30000"]
balanceAddr: 0xffffffff
psender: "0x10000"
```

### 2.5 Echidna Limitations (Learned)
```
❌ Doesn't understand Solidity types
   → Treats everything as uint256
   → Can generate invalid addresses, huge values
   → Must bound inputs: amt = (amt % MAX) + 1

❌ No vm.prank / vm.deal
   → Can't simulate multiple users easily
   → Must use harness contract with actor addresses

❌ Gas not modeled
   → Won't find gas DoS bugs
   → Won't find out-of-gas reverts

✅ Best for: INVARIANT VIOLATION
   → "This should ALWAYS be true"
   → Solvency, conservation, access control
   → Finds edge cases humans miss
```

## 3. HALMOS — REAL RESULTS

### 3.1 Symbolic Proofs (5 tests)
```bash
cd /tmp/halmos-test
halmos --contract SecurityProofs
```

**Result:**
```
[PASS] check_conservation(address,address,uint256,uint256)
       → 8 paths explored, ALL satisfy conservation
       
[PASS] check_owner_can_setOwner(address)
       → 2 paths, owner CAN change owner (positive case)
       
[PASS] check_withdraw_bounded(address,uint256,uint256)
       → 7 paths, withdraw never exceeds balance
       
[ERROR] check_onlyOwner_setOwner(address,address)
       → "all paths have been reverted" = PROVEN
       → Non-owner ALWAYS reverts (access control proven)
       
[ERROR] check_onlyOwner_emergency(address,address,uint256)
       → "all paths have been reverted" = PROVEN
       → Non-owner ALWAYS reverts

Symbolic test result: 3 passed; 2 "failed" (= PROVEN via revert)
```

### 3.2 Key Insight: "All Paths Reverted" = PROOF
```
Halmos explores ALL possible inputs symbolically.

If ALL paths revert → property is PROVEN for ALL inputs.
  → Not "tested 1M cases"
  → But "mathematically proven for ALL 2^256 possible values"

This is STRONGER than fuzzing:
  Fuzzing:  "I tried 100K random inputs, none broke it"
  Halmos:   "I PROVED no input can break it"

Pattern for access control proofs:
  function check_onlyOwner(address caller) public {
      vm.assume(caller != owner);
      vm.prank(caller);
      contract.adminFunction();  // Should revert for ALL non-owners
  }
  → If "all paths reverted" → access control PROVEN
```

### 3.3 Halmos Limitations (Learned)
```
❌ No vm.expectRevert()
   → Can't assert "this specific call reverts with X"
   → Workaround: let all paths revert = proof

❌ No vm.deal() for ETH
   → Can't easily set balances
   → Workaround: use vm.assume + existing balance

❌ Path explosion
   → Complex contracts = too many paths
   → Timeout on large codebases
   → Best for: focused proofs on critical functions

❌ No external calls
   → Can't test cross-contract interactions
   → Only tests single contract logic

✅ Best for: MATHEMATICAL PROOFS
   → Access control (proven for ALL addresses)
   → Arithmetic bounds (proven for ALL uint256)
   → State invariants (proven for ALL sequences)
```

## 4. MYTHRIL — REAL RESULTS

### 4.1 MinimalSwap Analysis (Clean)
```bash
cast code 0xCbEc...2C35 --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org > /tmp/swap_bytecode.txt
python3 -m mythril analyze -f /tmp/swap_bytecode.txt --bin-runtime \
  --execution-timeout 90 --max-depth 8 -t 2
```

**Result:**
```
The analysis was completed successfully. No issues were detected.

→ MinimalSwap is simple (direct pool swap)
→ No complex logic = no findings
→ Mythril works best on contracts with:
   - Multiple external calls
   - Complex arithmetic
   - Access control patterns
```

### 4.2 WETH Analysis (Finding!)
```bash
cast code 0x4200...0006 --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org > /tmp/weth_bytecode.txt
python3 -m mythril analyze -f /tmp/weth_bytecode.txt --bin-runtime \
  --execution-timeout 120 --max-depth 10 -t 3
```

**Result:**
```
==== Integer Arithmetic Bugs ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: MAIN
Function name: name()
PC address: 991

The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow.

→ FALSE POSITIVE: name() returns a string, no arithmetic
→ Mythril sees bytecode-level operations in string handling
→ This is why Mythril needs MANUAL triage
```

### 4.3 Mythril Commands
```bash
# From source
python3 -m mythril analyze contract.sol

# From bytecode file
python3 -m mythril analyze -f bytecode.txt --bin-runtime

# From address (needs RPC)
python3 -m mythril analyze -a 0x... --rpc mainnet.base.org:443 --rpctls true

# Specific modules
python3 -m mythril analyze contract.sol -m exceptions,arithmetic

# List all detectors
python3 -m mythril list-detectors

# JSON output
python3 -m mythril analyze contract.sol -o json -j results.json

# Increase depth (slower but deeper)
python3 -m mythril analyze contract.sol --max-depth 12 -t 5
```

### 4.4 Mythril Limitations (Learned)
```
❌ HIGH false positive rate
   → WETH name() "integer overflow" = nonsense
   → Must manually triage EVERY finding

❌ Slow on complex contracts
   → Path explosion on large codebases
   → execution-timeout needed (90-120s)

❌ Doesn't understand high-level patterns
   → Sees bytecode, not Solidity semantics
   → Can't detect business logic errors

❌ RPC connection finicky
   → --rpc flag format is HOST:PORT (not URL)
   → --rpctls needs argument (true/false)
   → Easier: download bytecode first, analyze offline

✅ Best for: BYTECODE-LEVEL ANALYSIS
   → Unverified contracts (no source)
   → Verifying deployed bytecode matches source
   → Finding low-level bugs (unchecked calls, reentrancy)
```

## 5. SCRIBBLE — STATUS

### 5.1 Installed (v0.7.10)
```bash
npx scribble --version  # 0.7.10
```

### 5.2 Syntax (Learned the hard way)
```solidity
// Scribble annotations use # prefix, NOT @
// #if_succeeds for postconditions
// #invariant for contract invariants

/// #if_succeeds balanceOf[msg.sender] <= old(balanceOf[msg.sender]);
function withdraw(uint256 shares) external returns (uint256 assets) { ... }

// Common syntax errors:
// ❌ @if_succeeds  → wrong prefix
// ❌ __ret          → not supported in this version
// ❌ {:old(x)}      → use old(x) instead
// ✅ old(x)         → correct
```

### 5.3 Workflow
```bash
# 1. Annotate contract with #if_succeeds / #invariant
# 2. Instrument (generates assertion code)
npx scribble Contract.sol -m flat --instrumentation-metadata-file meta.json

# 3. Run Echidna on instrumented contract
echidna Contract.instrumented.sol --contract Contract

# 4. If Echidna finds violation → annotation violated → BUG
```

  → Focus on Slither-flagged areas
  → Apply IRONCLAW_AUDIT_FRAMEWORK

STEP 3: Echidna (30 min - 2 hours)
  → Write invariants from manual review
  → Stateful fuzzing on critical paths
  → 100K+ runs for confidence

STEP 4: Halmos (30 min - 1 hour)
  → Prove access control properties
  → Prove arithmetic bounds
  → Mathematical certainty for critical functions

STEP 5: Mythril (30 min - 1 hour)
  → Bytecode-level analysis
  → Verify deployed contracts
  → Catch what Slither misses

STEP 6: Scribble + Echidna (optional)
  → Annotate postconditions
  → Instrument + fuzz
  → Find specification violations
```
